# COVID-19 Case Visualization

This project visualizes COVID-19 case data across neighbourhoods using Folium in Python. The interactive map provides insights into the distribution and density of COVID-19 cases, offering a geographical perspective on the pandemic's impact at the neighbourhood level.

## Description

This repository contains the code necessary to merge COVID-19 case data with geographic information of neighbourhoods and create a choropleth map that visualizes the number of cases in each neighbourhood.

## Features

- Data merging between case counts and geospatial neighbourhood data.
- Choropleth map generation with Folium.
- Interactive tooltips displaying case counts and neighbourhood names.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- geopandas
- folium

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas geopandas folium
